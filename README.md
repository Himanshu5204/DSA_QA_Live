🧠 What I Learned

During the development of DSA_QA_LIVE, I explored different tools and technologies beyond just HTML/CSS/JS.

🔹 Google Generative AI (Gemini API) – experimented with integrating AI-powered Q&A generation

Used system instruction and custom prompts to structure answers

Learned how to fine-tune responses for better clarity & relevance

🔹 Improved my understanding of frontend-backend interaction

How to fetch and display Q&A dynamically

Handling static deployment on GitHub Pages and API requests via Render

🔹 Practiced project structuring

Keeping frontend/ and backend/ organized

Maintaining clean separation of concerns

🔹 Enhanced my skills in documentation & open-source practices

Writing a good README

Using GitHub flow (fork, branch, pull request) for collaboration

🔹 Learn to deploy static pages on github and backend on render website
